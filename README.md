![](DOTD_NewMEAP_Harsanyi.png)

I'm currently writing a book with Manning that will be published in August/September 2022: 100 Go Mistakes.

The main idea is to list 100 of the most common mistakes made by Go developers in various aspects of the language: code and project organization, data structure, loops, error management, concurrency, testing, optimizations, etc.
