# Teiva Harsanyi

I’m a software engineer specializing in distributed systems, scalability, reliability, and observability topics. I’m currently working at Google as a senior software engineer in the ML SRE team. Meanwhile, I love meeting challenges, learning, and sharing.

I'm also the author of _[📖 100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them](https://www.manning.com/books/100-go-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)_ published by Manning in 2022.
