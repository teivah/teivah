## 100 Go Mistakes

![](DOTD_NewMEAP_Harsanyi.png)

I'm currently writing a book with Manning that will be published in 2022: 100 Go Mistakes.

The bookâ€™s main idea is to list 100 of the most common mistakes made by Go developers in various aspects of the language. Each mistake will be illustrated as far as possible with real-life examples. It should help Go developers in working smarter, not harder.
